                                <h2>Objective:</h2>
                                <p>The goal is to obtain a hand that totals 31 in cards of one suit; or to have a hand at the showdown whose count in one suit is higher than that of any other player.</p>
                                <h2>Card Values/Scoring</h2>
                                <p>An Ace counts 11 points, face cards count 10 points, and all other cards count their face value</p>
                                <h2>The Play:</h2>
                                <p>All players begin with 3 chips. On each turn, players take one card from either the top of the deck or from the widow (aka the discard pile). A turn ends by discarding a card from their hand.</p>
                                <p>Players take turns, until one player is satisfied that the card values he holds will likely beat all other players and "knocks" on the table. Once a knock has been made, all other players get one more turn to exchange cards before the showdown where all players reveal their hands and compare values.</p>
                                <h2>Scoring:</h2>
                                <p>If the player who knocked does not have the highest scoring hand at the showdown, they lose a chip to the pot.  However, if they do have the highest scoring hand, the player with the lowest hand loses a chip to the pot instead.</p>
                                <p>If there is a tie for the highest score, the player with the highest-ranking card wins. Example: K, Q, 6 (total 26) would beat Q, 9, 7 (also total 26). If there is a tie in the highest cards, the next highest cards are compared, and so on.</p>
                                <p>If at any point a player holds exactly 31 points during the game, or obtains three aces, the game immediately ends and all other players lose a chip to the pot.</p>
                                <p>After the pot has been won, all the players put in chips for the next hand.</p>
