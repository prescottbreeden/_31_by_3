PB edits last night:

show rules on menu, changed help to assist and added 3 card assist functionality that tells a human if the discard helps them at all, made it so assist always places the min card on the far right, added a partial sort method so that the remaining cards are sorted for user clarity after clicking assist, added error bubbles on all UX during gameplay, added non-porny music tracks (Take Five and Kind of Blue), added logic to calculate if a hand wins on the deal but was unable to trigger a scenario to test it.
